# Auth Migration Completion Plan

## Migration Status
✅ COMPLETED: The authentication system migration has been successfully completed with all components now using the direct auth approach. All tests have been migrated to use the direct auth system, and all deprecated files have been removed from the active codebase.

## Removed Files
The following deprecated files have been successfully removed from the codebase (moved to the backup folder):

1. ✅ **Legacy Auth Context:**
   - `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` → moved to backup folder

2. ✅ **Legacy Auth Service:**
   - `src/services/auth.service.ts` → moved to backup folder

3. ✅ **Legacy Auth Hook:**
   - `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` → moved to backup folder

## Verification Completed
Before removing these files, ensure:
1. The application builds successfully without errors
2. All authentication features work correctly
3. All tests pass without any references to these files

## Verification Results
✅ All tests pass successfully with the direct authentication system
✅ No remaining imports or references to the deprecated files
✅ All test files have been migrated to use the direct auth system

## Post-Migration Benefits
1. Simplified authentication architecture with store-based approach instead of React context
2. Improved testability through better separation of concerns
3. More consistent API surface for authentication operations
4. Reduced bundle size by eliminating duplicate authentication logic

## Migration Benefits
- Simplified authentication flow with a single approach
- Reduced code duplication and maintenance burden
- Improved codebase organization and readability
- Clearer dependencies and better testability
