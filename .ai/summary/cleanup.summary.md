# 10xCards Codebase Cleanup Summary

This document tracks the progress of the codebase cleanup process.

## Step 1: Identify Unused/Test Files
*Started: June 3, 2025*

### Findings:

#### Backend Services
1. **Duplicate Authentication Services**:
   - `src/services/auth.service.ts`: Being replaced by `auth.direct.ts`
   - `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`: Legacy context-based auth system being phased out

2. **Test-Only Files**:
   - `tests/unit/services/openrouter.service.test.ts`
   - `tests/unit/services/openrouter.service.mock.test.ts`
   - `src/services/__tests__/*.test.ts` (All service test files)

3. **Core Services in Use**:
   - `src/services/base.service.ts`: Foundation for all services
   - `src/services/card.service.ts`: Card CRUD operations
   - `src/services/card-set.service.ts`: Card set management
   - `src/services/generation.service.ts`: Flashcard generation
   - `src/lib/services/openrouter.service.ts`: AI integration for card generation

#### Authentication System
âœ… **COMPLETED**: Authentication migration has been successfully completed!

**Current auth system** (store-based approach):
   - `src/services/auth.direct.ts`: Direct authentication service
   - `src/hooks/useDirectAuth.ts`: React hook for direct auth

**Legacy system** has been removed (moved to backup folder):
   - `src/services/auth.service.ts`
   - `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`
   - `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`

Full details documented in:
   - `.ai/summary/auth-migration-progress.md` 
   - `.ai/summary/auth-migration-completion-plan.md`

#### UI Components
1. **Duplicate Auth Components**:
   - Multiple login form implementations:
     - `src/components/auth/LoginForm.astro`
     - `src/components/auth/LoginFormReact.tsx`

#### API Integration
- API endpoints properly use services:
  - Card API uses `CardService`
  - Card Sets API uses `CardSetService`
  - Generation API uses `GenerationService`

## Step 2: Identify Incomplete/Stubbed Areas
*Started: June 3, 2025*

### Existing TODOs in Code
1. `src/hooks/useCardSets.ts`: 
   - Line 23: "TODO: Replace with actual API call"

2. `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`: 
   - Line 29: "TODO: Add any necessary side effects based on auth state changes"

3. `src/components/review/ReviewContent.tsx`: 
   - Line 106: "TODO: Add state updates or side effects based on cards here"

4. `src/services/generation.service.ts`: 
   - Line 135: "TODO: Remove 'as unknown as' after regenerating Supabase types to include 'generation_results'"

### Missing Features From User Stories
Based on the user stories and our findings, the following features appear to be incomplete or missing entirely:

1. **US-007: Generation Statistics**
   - No statistics components or services implemented
   - No dashboard for viewing generation metrics

2. **US-008: Readability Assessment**
   - No components or services for readability analysis
   - No FOG index calculation or text improvement suggestions

3. **US-011: Personal Data Management**
   - No profile/account management components
   - No data export functionality
   - No account deletion implementation

### Actions Completed
1. Added TODO comments for missing features:
   - Statistics dashboard in `src/components/dashboard/DashboardContent.tsx`
   - Readability assessment in `src/components/generate/GenerateContent.tsx`
   - Personal data management in `src/components/auth/UserMenu.tsx`
2. Created a mock profile component at `src/components/account/ProfileContent.tsx` with TODOs
3. Created a comprehensive TODO list in `.ai/summary/todo-list.md`
4. Consolidated auth services:
   - Migrated `AuthGuard.tsx` to use direct auth
   - Rewrote `ForgotPasswordForm.tsx` to use direct auth
   - Marked legacy auth files as deprecated
   - Added migration progress tracking in `.ai/summary/auth-migration-progress.md`

### Next Steps
1. **Complete Auth Migration**: Update any remaining components still using legacy auth
2. **Clean up Tests**: Update tests to use the direct auth system
3. **Begin Backend Cleanup**: Continue with service refactoring
4. **Clean up UI Components**: Remove unused components and fix duplicated login forms
