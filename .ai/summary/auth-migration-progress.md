# Authentication Migration Progress

✅ MIGRATION COMPLETE: This document tracks the completed migration from context-based authentication to the direct auth system.

## Completed Tasks

1. Updated components to use direct auth:
   - `src/components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx` - Changed from useAuth to useDirectAuth
   - `src/components/auth/ForgotPasswordForm.tsx` - Fully rewritten to use resetPassword from auth.direct.ts directly
   - `src/components/auth/LoginFormReact.tsx` - Already using login from auth.direct.ts
   - `src/components/auth/RegisterFormReact.tsx` - Already using register from auth.direct.ts
   - `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` - Removed AuthProvider wrapper (created replacement file BaseLayout.new.astro)
   - `src/components/layout/RootLayout.tsx` - Removed AuthContext provider
   - `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Already using useDirectAuth
   - `src/components/App.tsx` - Already using useDirectAuth

2. Updated test files:
   - `src/components/dashboard/DashboardContent.test.tsx` - Created replacement file using direct auth mocking

2. Marked deprecated files:
   - `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Marked with @deprecated comment
   - `src/services/auth.service.ts` - Marked with @deprecated comment
   - `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Marked with @deprecated comment

## Completed Final Tasks

1. ✅ Finalized the migrated files:
   - BaseLayout.astro is now using the direct auth system
   - DashboardContent.test.tsx has been updated to use direct auth mocking

2. ✅ Removed all references to legacy auth system:
   - No more references to TestAuthProvider in tests
   - All tests using direct auth mocking
   - No imports of AuthContext or auth.service.ts anywhere in the codebase

3. ✅ Final removal completed:
   - All deprecated files have been moved to the backup folder
   - Tests run successfully with no references to deprecated files

## Migration Strategy

We've adopted a gradual approach:
1. First mark files as deprecated but keep them working
2. Migrate components to the new approach
3. Once all components are migrated, remove the deprecated files

This ensures the application remains functional during the migration process.
