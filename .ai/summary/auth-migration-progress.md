# Authentication Migration Progress

This document tracks the progress of migrating from context-based authentication to the direct auth system.

## Completed Tasks

1. Updated components to use direct auth:
   - `src/components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx` - Changed from useAuth to useDirectAuth
   - `src/components/auth/ForgotPasswordForm.tsx` - Fully rewritten to use resetPassword from auth.direct.ts directly
   - `src/components/auth/LoginFormReact.tsx` - Already using login from auth.direct.ts
   - `src/components/auth/RegisterFormReact.tsx` - Already using register from auth.direct.ts
   - `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` - Removed AuthProvider wrapper (created replacement file BaseLayout.new.astro)
   - `src/components/layout/RootLayout.tsx` - Removed AuthContext provider
   - `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Already using useDirectAuth
   - `src/components/App.tsx` - Already using useDirectAuth

2. Updated test files:
   - `src/components/dashboard/DashboardContent.test.tsx` - Created replacement file using direct auth mocking

2. Marked deprecated files:
   - `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Marked with @deprecated comment
   - `src/services/auth.service.ts` - Marked with @deprecated comment
   - `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Marked with @deprecated comment

## Remaining Tasks

1. Test and finalize the migrated files:
   - Test BaseLayout.new.astro and rename to BaseLayout.astro if working correctly
   - Test DashboardContent.test.new.tsx and rename to DashboardContent.test.tsx if passing

2. Update any remaining references to AuthContext or auth.service.ts:
   - Check remaining tests for usage of TestAuthProvider
   - Ensure all tests are updated to use direct auth mocking

3. Final removal:
   - Once all components and tests are updated, remove deprecated files

## Migration Strategy

We've adopted a gradual approach:
1. First mark files as deprecated but keep them working
2. Migrate components to the new approach
3. Once all components are migrated, remove the deprecated files

This ensures the application remains functional during the migration process.
